# Cognito – Graduation Project

Cognito is a web-based learning platform designed to help students discover their IT skill level and guide them through a personalized learning journey. The system focuses on assessing users through a placement test, identifying their level, and allowing them to select an appropriate IT field to continue learning in a structured and adaptive way.

This repository represents the main project workspace for the Cognito Graduation Project. It demonstrates a functional and integrated system, not a throwaway prototype, and reflects the core architecture planned for the final product.

## Project Overview
The project is implemented as a full-stack web application consisting of:
- A frontend module that provides an interactive and animated user interface.
- A backend module that handles authentication, placement test logic, scoring, and data management.
- A database module that stores users, questions, answers, scores, and related entities.

The system allows users to:
- Register and log in securely.
- Take a placement test to evaluate their IT knowledge.
- Receive a level and score based on their performance.
- Select an IT field and view their progress through a dashboard.

## Repository Structure
The project is organized into separate modules for clarity and maintainability:

- Frontend: Contains the React-based user interface (pages, components, routing, and styling).
- Backend: Contains the Node.js / Express server, APIs, and business logic.
- Database: Contains SQL schema and database dump files used to initialize the system database.

Each module includes its own README file with detailed instructions on setup, execution, and technical details.

## Implementation Status
The current implementation represents the core functionality required for GP1, including:
- User authentication (signup and login).
- Placement test loading, submission, and scoring.
- Level calculation and result storage.
- Field selection and dashboard display.
- Frontend-backend-database integration.

Additional features and enhancements are planned for GP2.

## Documentation
Detailed documentation is provided at multiple levels:
- This README gives a high-level overview of the entire project.
- Separate README files are available inside the frontend, backend, and database directories, describing each module in detail.
- Inline comments are included in the code to explain key logic and design decisions.

## GitHub Repository
The complete project source code, including implemented frontend and backend modules, is available in this repository and is actively maintained as part of the graduation project development.
